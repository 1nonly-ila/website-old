# My Personal Website

Originally made by [@tarikcoskun](https://github.com/tarikcoskun). Forked and edited by me.
Made with Vue.js and WindiCSS.

> Firstly, [i cloned Tarık's design on another repo](https://github.com/toasting-ops/tarik-site-klon) for improving myself. After that i decided to fork original repo and merge my clone with fork, so this is not a full fork. Coded from zero with Vue.js and WindiCSS. But all design rights belong to Tarık.

Thanks to [@tarikcoskun](https://github.com/tarikcoskun) for this beautiful website.
