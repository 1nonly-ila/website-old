  "description": "Howdy! I'm TarÄ±k, a young Front-End developer from Turkey. I spend most of my time playing games, coding and chatting. I have been coding since 2018, when I started using Discord. I've always wondered how Discord bots work, so I started coding Discord bots. In 2019, I started creating Discord bot dashboards and since then, I'm trying to create websites using new technologies I learn. In late 2020, I started learning Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS and this website is only example for now.",
